# TMDB Laravel Fullstack example

 I made this application with laravel in back-end(api) and vue in front-end(spa).

## Installation

Clone this repo and cd into it

```
cd Teste-Full-Stack-TMDB 
```
After this run ``` composer install ``` command to install all laravel's packages, and then run ```npm install``` to install front-end packages.

Finally run ```php artisan serve``` and ```npm run dev``` to start laravel server and compile front-end files.

```
php artisan serve && npm run dev
```
